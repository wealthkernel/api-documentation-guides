## ISA Declarations

An ISA declaration is a statement of confirmation that needs to be agreed to by a customer before a subscription can be added to an ISA or JISA.

## ISAs

The declaration for an ISA confirms that the customer:

- is over the age of 18
- has not and will not subscribe more than the permitted allowance in any combination of ISAs in the same tax year
- has not and will not subscribe to another stocks and share ISA in the same tax year
- is a resident of the UK (or permitted non-resident)

After completing a declaration, the customer can make subscriptions to their ISA account as long as the ISA is still open. The ISA declaration does not expire.

Note that, historically, ISA declarations would only remain valid when contributions were made in consecutive years; this changed in the 2024-25 fiscal year when HMRC abolished these rules. All ISA declarations that were completed prior to these changes have been updated and are now valid indefinitely.

## JISAs

The declaration for a JISA confirms that:

- either the applicant is over 16 and is the child, or the applicant is over 18 and has parental responsibility for the child
- the child does not hold a Child Trust Fund
- the child does not hold another stocks and shares JISA
- the child is a UK resident (or permitted non-resident)
- the applicant is the person who will be registered contact on the JISA
- the total subscriptions of the JISA will not exceed the allowance for the tax year across the permitted combination of JISA accounts
