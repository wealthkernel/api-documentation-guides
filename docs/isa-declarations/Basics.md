## ISA Declarations

An ISA declaration is a statement of confirmation that needs to be agreed to by a customer before a subscription can be added to an ISA or JISA.

## ISAs

The declaration for an ISA confirms that the customer:

- is over the age of 18
- has not and will not subscribe more than the permitted allowance in any combination of ISAs in the same tax year
- has not and will not subscribe to another stocks and share ISA in the same tax year
- is a resident of the UK (or permitted non-resident)

After completing a declaration, the customer can continue to make subscriptions for the remainder of the tax year. As long as a customer makes at least one subscription in the tax year, the declaration will rollover to the following tax year. This will continue indefinitely until there is a year with no subscriptions.

Following a tax year with no subscriptions, if a customer wishes to further subscribe to their ISA, a new declaration will need to be completed. 

## JISAs

The declaration for a JISA confirms that:

- the applicant is over 16 and is either the child or has parental responsibility for the child
- the child does not hold a Child Trust Fund
- the child does not hold another stocks and shares JISA
- the child is a UK resident (or permitted non-resident)
- the applicant is the person who will be registered contact on the JISA
- the total subscriptions of the JISA will not exceed the allowance for the tax year across the permitted combination of JISA accounts
