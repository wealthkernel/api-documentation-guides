# Timings

There are several timings to be aware of when setting and taking payments via Direct Debits.

The first is setting up a mandate.  This typically takes 2 business days.  It is performed once for a customer’s bank account.  A new mandate must be set up for their new bank account if a customer changes their bank account.

There are several timings related to taking a payment using Direct Debits.  Direct Debits use the UK’s BACS payment system and thus are subject to the timeframes of the BACS payment system.

## Creating a payment for a customer

The first payment taken from a new customer’s account will require authorisation to be set up and will take 4 business days before the customer is charged, assuming the payment is submitted before the BACS cut off time of 4pm GMT.

Payments created for a customer with an active authorisation will result in the customer being charged after 3 business working days.

Note, if the payment is created after the 4pm cut off time, or created on a weekend or bank holiday, the process will begin on the next working day.

## Funds available in the customer’s portfolio

It takes 2 working days to receive the money into our bank account and the funds will be available in the customer's portfolio later that night. If the customer doesn't have a direct debit mandate set up, it will take an additional two working days.
