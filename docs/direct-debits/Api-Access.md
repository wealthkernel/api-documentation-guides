# Getting Access to the API

All Direct Debit APIs are openly available in the sandbox environment. In order to access these APIs in Live the following steps must be completed to satisfy compliance requirements:

1. Our legal arrangements covering the usage of the Direct Debit facility and commercial terms have been agreed.
2. Your retail customer Terms & Conditions have been updated to include the Direct Debit payment service.
3. The design content of your customer facing screens used to set up a Direct Debit mandate are approved based on the [guidelines](./UI-Guidlines.md) outlined below.
4. Your maximum and minimum limits per payment have been agreed. The minimum Direct Debit payment is £25 as a default and the maximum is £2000.
5. When the Direct Debit APIs are available to you, the Admin Portal Direct Debit information screens will also be made visible.
