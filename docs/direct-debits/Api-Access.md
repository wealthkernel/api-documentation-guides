# Getting Access to the API

All Direct Debit APIs are available in the sandbox environment. To access these APIs in Production you must complete the following steps to meet compliance requirements:

1. You must agree to our commercial terms and legal arrangements covering the usage of the Direct Debit facility.
2. You must have updated your retail customer Terms & Conditions to include the Direct Debit payment service.
3. The UI of the customer facing screens used to set up a Direct Debit mandate must be approved based on the  [guidelines](./UI-Guidelines.md) outlined.
4. The minimum and maximum limits per payment must be agreed if the defaults are not suitable. By default the minimum amount per payment is £25 and the maximum is £2000.
5. When the Direct Debit APIs are available to you the Admin Portal Direct Debit information screens will also be made visible.
