# Getting Access to the API

All Direct Debit APIs are openly available in the sandbox environment. In order to access these APIs in Live the following steps must be completed to satisfy compliance requirements:

1. Our legal arrangements covering the usage of the Direct Debit facility and commercial terms have been agreed.
2. Your retail customer Terms & Conditions have been updated to include the Direct Debit payment service.
3. The design content of your customer facing screens used to set up a Direct Debit mandate are approved based on the [guidelines](#ui-guidelines) outlined below.
4. Your maximum and minimum limits per payment have been agreed. The minimum Direct Debit payment is £25 as a default and the maximum is £2000.
5. When the Direct Debit APIs are available to you, the Admin Portal Direct Debit information screens will also be made visible.

## UI Guidelines
The content of your customer facing screens for setting up a Direct Debit mandate must be approved as "Payment Services Regulations" compliant. This regulation covers the set up of the mandate. As such the designs for the UI of screens relating to payments/contributions do not need approval.

We would ask that you follow these guidelines as closely as possible to avoid delay in gaining approval and to prevent problems arising when regulators force change.

### Page 1 - Bank Account Capture
The first page must capture the back account to be used for the mandate. See the example below
