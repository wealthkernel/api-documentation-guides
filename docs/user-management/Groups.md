# Groups

The groups page can be found under the 'Configuration' area of the nav menu.

Groups are used to control which permissions your users have.  By default, a newly created user does not belong to 
any groups.  To allow them to perform various tasks in the dashboard, assign them to an existing group, or create a 
new group with custom permissions.
