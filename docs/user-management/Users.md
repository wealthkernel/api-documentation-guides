# Users

The users page can be found under the 'Configuration' area of the nav menu.

![Users nav](../../assets/images/user-management/nav-users.png)

To invite a new user to the dashboard, click the 'Add user' button at the top of the Users page

![Add user](../../assets/images/user-management/add-user.png)

Fill in the user's name and email address.  They will receive an email inviting them to log in.

## User settings

The user page shows you their status and which groups they currently belong to.  (See the [Groups](./Groups.md) 
page for more details on group and permission configuration)

![User details](../../assets/images/user-management/user-detail.png)

The '...' menu in the top right allows you to perform various actions for a user.  (Note: the 'reset password' 
option will be hidden if your organization uses single-sign-on (SSO))

![User actions](../../assets/images/user-management/user-detail-actions.png)

Disabling a user will keep their settings, but prevent them from logging in.  Deleting a user will remove them from the 
dashboard entirely.
