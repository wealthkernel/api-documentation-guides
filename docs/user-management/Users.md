Fill in the user's name and email address.  They will receive an email inviting them to log in.

## User settings

The user page shows you their status and which groups they currently belong to.  (See the [Groups](./Groups.md) 
page for more details on group and permission configuration)

The '...' menu in the top right allows you to perform various actions for a user.  (Note: the exact actions may vary 
depending on whether you use single-sign-on (SSO) or a username and password to log in)

Disabling a user will keep their settings, but prevent them from logging in.  Deleting a user will remove them from the 
dashboard entirely.
