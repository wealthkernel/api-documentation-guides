# Managing secrets

If you are a Dashboard admin user, you have permission to manage API clients and secrets for authenticating against the WealthKernel API.

API secrets are used as part of our authentication method. Documentation for this can be found <a href="/docs/api/docs/help/Authentication.md">here</a>.

## Generating a secret

1. Log in to the dashboard and go to Configuration -> API clients.
