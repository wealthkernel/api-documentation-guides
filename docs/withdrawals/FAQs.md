# Withdrawal FAQs

## What should be used as a withdrawal's reference?

The only limitation is a maximum of 50 characters, otherwise this is up to you. You might choose to generate something unique or partially unique concatenated with something more readable for your users to be able to tell withdrawals apart.

## Why has a withdrawal been rejected?

There could be a number of reasons a withdrawal has been rejected:

- The provided bank account or default bank account is not active.
- There is already an active withdrawal.
- Party's account is not active.
- There is insufficient balance to fulfil the withdrawal request.
