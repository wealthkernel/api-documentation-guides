# Deposit FAQs

## What should be used as a deposit's reference?

You should agree with WealthKernel a reference prefix to use and the remainder of the reference should be something highly unique to increase the chances of successful matching.

## Why has a deposit not matched?

There could be a number of reasons a deposit has not automatically matched:

- Party has transferred a deposit with an unexpected reference.
- Party has transferred from a non-nominated bank account.
- Party's account or portfolio is not active.
- Party's account has a subscription limit which has been reached (e.g. Â£20,000 ISA limit).
- The party is no longer eligible to contribute (e.g. if they are a non-UK resident and are contributing to an ISA).

## What happens if a deposit cannot be matched?

We will hold the deposit for 10 days and contact you to try to resolve the destination portfolio. If it cannot be matched on the 10th day we will return the deposit to the originating account.

The deposit expectation will remain allowing your customer to retry the payment with correct amount/reference/account. We will keep a deposit expectations with a status of 'Created' for up to 90 days, after which we will cancel the deposit.
