# Performance FAQs

## Why is performance less than expected?

If WealthKernel is unaware of how your fees are being accrued, they will only be represented in cash flow, meaning the final net figure will not be accurate.

## Where is the performance for Saturday and Sunday?

Performance is not calculated individually on these days, instead it is included in the figure for Monday.

## Why has the performance figure changed?

As with many aspects of our system, there may be a need for corrections. For example, if we receive incorrect data from a supplier. This results in corrective action being taken, and a recalculation of performance.
