# Interest

## How interest is paid

Interest is paid on the 1st of each month on an accrual basis.

## Interest rates

Interest rates can be configured per product, split between the investor and the tenant, up to a maximum of the current [Bank of England base rate](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate). Contact your tenant manager to configure your products.

## Rate changes

Interest rates will change in line with the Bank of England base rate.

## Cut offs

Internal transfers must be requested before the cut off to be eligible for current day's interest accrual. After this time interest will not be accrued until the next working day.

## Withdrawals

If cash is transferred out of the savings portfolio, interest earned will be paid as usual on the 1st of the next month, accrued for the days which it was held in the savings portfolio.

For example, if Â£100 was held in a savings portfolio from 2025-01-01, and a transfer back to the wallet completes on 2025-01-15, 14 days worth of interest would be paid into the savings portfolio on 2025-02-01.

## Fractional interest

Fractional amounts of interest less than a penny will be rounded to the nearest penny. Any remaining fractional interest will be rolled over to the next month.
