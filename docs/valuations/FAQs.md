# Valuations FAQs

## What transactions are included in a valuation?

All transactions belonging to the portfolio with a timestamp on or before a valuation's date will be reflected in the valuation.

## Can a valuation change once calculated?

Yes, although valuations are dated daily, transactions can be booked that affect existing valuations, causing their values to change. For example, an incorrectly dated Dividend transaction being rebooked for the correct date.

In other words, transactions with a timestamp on or before a valuationâ€™s date will be reflected in the valuation, even if they are booked retrospectively days after the valuation date. This effect perpetuates through all valuations up to the current valuation.

## Why haven't the valuations been created yet?

In rare circumstances due delays with our downstream providers, we may be delayed in receiving data required to calculate valuations. As soon as the data arrives with us will we endeavour to generate valuations as soon as possible.
