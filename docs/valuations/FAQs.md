# Valuations FAQs

## What transactions are included in a valuation?

All transactions belonging to the portfolio with a timestamp on or before a valuation's date will be reflected in the valuation.

## Can a valuation change once calculated?

Yes. Although valuations are updated daily, transactions can be recorded retroactively, impacting all existing valuations from the transaction's date up to the latest valuation. For example, an incorrectly dated Dividend transaction may be rebooked for the correct date.

## Why haven't the valuations been created yet?

In rare circumstances, we may experience delays in receiving the data needed to calculate valuations from our downstream providers.
