# JISA transfers

## Requirements

Each inbound JISA transfer request must satisfy the following requirements:

- The account that the portfolio is under must be a JISA.
- The registered contact details including name and address have to be provided.

## JISA subscriptions

After the inbound JISA transfer funds have been received, we will upload the JISA transfer history document, which tells us how much of the current year's subscription has been used. We will also update the JISA's ISA subscription resource. At this point the inbound transfer will be completed.
