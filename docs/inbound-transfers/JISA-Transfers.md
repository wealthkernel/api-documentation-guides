# JISA Transfers

## Requirements
Each inbound JISA transfer request must satisfy the following requirements:
- The registered contact details including name and address have to be provided.
- The account that the portfolio is under must be a JISA.

## ISA Subscriptions
After the inbound JISA transfer funds have been received, we will upload the ISA transfer history document, which tells us how much of the current year's subscription has been used. We will also update the ISA subscription resource. At this point the inbound transfer will be completed.
