# ISA Transfers

## Requirements
Each inbound ISA transfer request must satisfy the following requirements:
- The account that the portfolio is under must be an ISA.

## ISA Subscriptions
After the inbound ISA transfer funds have been received, we will upload the ISA transfer history document, which tells us how much of the current year's subscription has been used. We will also update the ISA subscription resource. At this point the inbound transfer will be completed.
