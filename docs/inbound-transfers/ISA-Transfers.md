- The account that the portfolio is under must be an ISA.

## ISA transfer history details
After the funds were received and are available in the WealthKernel portfolio the status of the transfer will be updated to Transferred. To complete the transfer you be required to upload transfer history detalis, after the status will be updated to Completed.

## ISA Subscriptions
After the inbound ISA transfer is completed, we will upload the ISA transfer history document, which tells us how much of the current year's subscription has been used. We will also update the ISA subscription resource.
