# ISA Subscription Basics

Any account which is a type of ISA will have a subscription. An ISA Subscription keeps track of how much a user has subscribed towards their ISA account in a given tax year. This includes when a user deposits money into their portfolio, as well as a user transferring an ISA from a previous provider. Note that depending on various factors, it may take some time for the subscription amount to be updated in the case of an ISA transfer.

It's worth noting that not all changes to a portfolio mean a change to the corresponding ISA Subscription. The following do not change the value of an ISA Subscription:

- Dividends
- A change in value of the assets
- Buys and sells
- Charges
- Withdrawals

# Entering a New Tax Year

If an ISA remains with us at the end of the tax year, we'll automatically start a new ISA Subscription for that account, for the new tax year. If that ISA has been transferred to a new provider, we won't.
