# ISA Subscription Basics

<!-- theme: info -->
> This API is only available in our sandbox environment

Any account which is a type of ISA or JISA will have a subscription. A subscription keeps track of how much a party has subscribed towards their account in a given tax year. This includes money is deposited into their portfolio(s), as well as a party transferring an ISA/JISA from a previous provider. Note that depending on various factors, it may take some time for the subscription amount to be updated in the case of a transfer.

Be aware that not all changes to a portfolio mean a change to the corresponding subscription. The following do not change the value of a subscription:

## For all ISAs

- Dividends
- A change in value of the assets
- Buys and sells
- Charges

## For non-flexible ISAs
- Withdrawals

# Entering a New Tax Year

If an ISA or JISA remains with us at the end of the tax year, we'll automatically start a new subscription for that account, for the new tax year. If it has been transferred to a new provider, we won't.
