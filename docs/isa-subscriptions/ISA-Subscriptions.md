# ISA Subscription Basics

An ISA Subscription keeps track of how much a user has subscribed towards their ISA account in a given tax year. This includes when a user deposits money into their portfolio, as well as a user transferring an ISA from a previous provider. Any account which is a type of ISA will have a subscription.

It's worth noting that not all changes to a portfolio mean a change to the corresponding ISA subscription. The following do not change the value of an ISA Subscription:

- Dividends
- An change in value of the assets held in the portfolio
- Buys and sells
- Charges
- Withdrawals

# The New Tax Year

If an ISA account still exists with us at the end of the tax year, we'll automatically start a new ISA Subscription of that account, for the new tax year. If that ISA has been transferred to a new provider, we won't.
