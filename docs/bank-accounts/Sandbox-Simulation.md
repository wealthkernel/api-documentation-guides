# Sandbox simulation

By default, when you create a bank account in Sandbox, it will move to the `Active` status almost immediately. You can change this behaviour to simulate other scenarios:

## Suspended status

If the bank account has the sort code `00-00-00` it will move to `Suspended`.

## Pending status

If the bank account has the sort code `00-00-01` it will stay in `Pending`.
